    /*A variable can be thought of as a container in which information of a given type can be stored.
    Examples of these different types include text (String),
    whole numbers (int),
    floating-point numbers (double),
    and whether something is true or false (boolean).
    A value is assigned to a variable using the equals sign (=).


    Although Java is object-oriented, not all types are objects. It is built on top of basic variable types called primitives.

        Here is a list of all primitives in Java:

        byte (number, 1 byte)
        short (number, 2 bytes)
        int (number, 4 bytes)
        long (number, 8 bytes)
        float (float number, 4 bytes)
        double (float number, 8 bytes)
        char (a character, 2 bytes)
        boolean (true or false, 1 byte)
        Java is a strong-typed language, which means variables need to be defined before we use them.

    /*
            Declaring a variable in Java.
        In Java it is mandatory to declare a variable before use. Syntax for variable declaration in Java is as follows-

        type variable_name = value
        int age = 65;

          //declaration
        int age;
        ..
        ..
        // initialization
        age = 65;

        To declare and assign a number use the following syntax:
        int myNumber;
        myNumber = 5;
        Or you can combine them:
        int myNumber = 5;

        //declaration and initialization of a char variable
        char ch = 'a';

        //declaration variable of type double.
        double d;

        In fact every block of code creates a new scope and any variable declared with in the opening and closing braces of that block has the scope with in that block.

    It is a variable whose value is instance-specific and now shared among instances.  	                    It is a variable that defines a specific attribute or property for a class.
    These variables cannot be shared between classes. Instead, they only belong to one specific class.  	These variables can be shared between class and its subclasses.
    It usually reserves memory for data that the class needs.  	                                            It usually maintains a single shared value for all instances of class even if no instance object of the class exists.
    It is generally created when an instance of the class is created.  	                                    It is generally created when the program begins to execute.
    It normally retains values as long as the object exists.  	                                            It normally retains values until the program terminates.
    It has many copies so every object has its own personal copy of the instance variable. 	                It has only one copy of the class variable so it is shared among different objects of the class.
    It can be accessed directly by calling variable names inside the class.  	                            It can be accessed by calling with the class name.
    These variables are declared without using the static keyword.  	                                    These variables are declared using the keyword static.
    Changes that are made to these variables through one object will not reflect in another object.  	    Changes that are made to these variables through one object will reflect in another object.
